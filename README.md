## 2018.2.27(problem solve)
Changing today date's number to star shape. 

## 2018.3.5 (problem solve)

The problem of this code was I didn't change the system date to 1st day. 
For example if today is 2018.3.5 Monday 
``
calendar.day of week 
``
it prints 2. (Because day start with sunday)
I only set year and month. So everyday 1st day has been changed and it doesn't fit 
with real calendar. So I set to 1st day and solve the problem.
