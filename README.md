## 2018.2.27(problem solve)
Changing today date's number to star shape. 

## 2018.3.5 (problem solve)

The problem of this code was I didn't change the system date to 1st day. 
For example, if today is 2018.3.5 Monday 
``
calendar.day of week 
``
it prints 2. (Because day start with sunday)
I only set year and month by scanner. I should have changed day to 1st day to figure out what date is 1st day. 
So everyday startday(code) changed and problem occured. I thought problem was star shape but it was not.
My Jcalendar doesn't fit with real calendar. So I set day to 1st day and solve the problem. 

## 2018.3.7 (update)

Making code more readability
